				<p>
					Apps may run with the Tradeshift navigation interface (the chrome) visually hidden, while
					still technically running inside the Tradeshift chrome – and showing the Tradeshift URL in
					the address bar.
				</p>

						The Supplier Registration app takes over the full viewport while running on Tradeshift.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					Under normal conditions any app should rarely have the need to take over the full
					viewport. The approach is also only recommended for flows where new users need to perform
					certain actions before using Tradeshift. Expect users who are used to using Tradeshift to
					want to have access to the global navigation.
