			<h1>Buttons</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					A collection of button styles exist to visually prioritize the possible actions in your
					application. Styles include the color, size and position of the buttons. Applying these
					button styles correctly will
					<a href="http://tradeshift.github.io/#design/guidelines/principles.html" data-ts="Button"
						>help the user focus</a
					>
					on the most likely next action.
				</p>

				<p>
					By prioritizing the user flows in your application you will know which flows are most
					likely to be used by the majority of users. One way of making these most likely paths
					clear to the users is by applying the appropriate button styles.
				</p>

				<p>Four main button styles exist:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Primary button:</strong> The most likely action the user will take. On desktop
						and tablet size interface, this button is almost always positioned in the top right
						corner of the window or it’s attached at the end of the content in the main content
						area.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Secondary button(s):</strong> Functionality that many users will need but
						without which the application pages would still work. The secondary button(s) are
						located to the left of the primary button on desktop and tablet size interface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Tertiary button(s):</strong> Functionality that isn’t often used by the majority
						of users should be styled and positioned as tertiary buttons. Example: exporting or
						deleting a viewed document.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Kill button:</strong> Functionality that performs a deletion or rejection
						action. These buttons are visually styled to alert the user and are most often placed in
						<a href="http://tradeshift.github.io/#design/patterns/pickers.html" data-ts="Button"
							>pickers</a
						>
						to confirm an action.
						<em>Example: confirming the deletion of a document.</em>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					It’s worth spending some time reviewing functionality such as invoice creation and viewing
					in Tradeshift to see these principles in action.

					Above is the invoice creation screen. The <em>Send button</em> is primary for this
					functionality. <em>Preview</em> is secondary and <em>Discard</em> is tertiary. A number of
					other tertiary actions are grouped within the triple-dot (···) icon. These are actions
					such as importing document contents from a file, sending a test email with the document
					attached, etc.

					Above is a <em>Kill button</em> which confirms the action of deleting a document. It’s
					styled to indicate the destructive nature of it’s action.
