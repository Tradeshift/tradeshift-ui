			<h1>Tables</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					The core table designs in Tradeshift aim to be similar to best practices and existing
					standards. Due to the responsive nature of Tradeshift UI, some extra considerations should
					be made to ensure that the user can access and understand the information contained. For
					tables, the following concepts should be considered.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Line-wrapping:</strong> When enabled, text inside table cells will break to
						multiple lines, if there’s not enough horisontal space. Disabling
						<em>line-wrapping</em> makes every row same height, as text inside cells is only one
						line. Proper handling of relative cell-widths and overflow is important when lines are
						not allowed to wrap.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Row-selection:</strong> When enabled, each line has a checkbox in the first left
						column. This column is fixed, so if the table scrolls horisontally, the selector (first)
						column stays in place. This allows the user to make selections while browsing all
						columns.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Clickable rows:</strong> In many cases table rows represent single
						<em>objects</em> and are clickable. This is symbolised by having a last column
						containing three dots (···).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Responsive column handling:</strong> To better adapt to the available screen
						space – mainly width – careful consideration of text-overflow and hiding/showing columns
						should be done. In cases where an entire row is clickable and links to an
						<em>object</em>, columns can often be left out in small-device table views, as the
						contents of these columns will be visible on the object anyway.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					When <em>line-wrapping</em> is disabled, text in cells stay on one line keeping rows same
					height. Enabling <em>row-selection</em>, provides a checkbox in the first column, that is
					fixed on a scrolling table.
				</p>

				</figure>

				<p>
					Here <em>line-wrapping</em> is enabled so text in cells flows into multiple lines.
					<em>Row-selection</em> is disabled, so there’s no checkbox per row.
				</p>

				<h3>Row selection</h3>

				<p>
					The video below visualises how bulk actions (light blue bar) appear when rows are
					selected. The bulk actions are only possible when row-selection is enabled.
				</p>

				<h3>Small device considerations</h3>

				<p>
					For smaller screens it’s worth deciding which columns to hide, if any. Aim at scrolling in
					only one direction (vertical) whenever possible. In the example below, the lines are
					clickable (···) and all details can be provided in the object view, instead of trying to
					get everything into the table.
