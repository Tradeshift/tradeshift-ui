			<h1>Option lists and pickers</h1>
			<section class="desc">
				<p>
					In most cases Tradeshift’s user interface doesn’t rely on the standard select element for
					option selection. Instead options are presented in layered lists. This is what we call
					<em>Pickers</em>.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>
					Structurally the Pickers allow the presentation of more complex selection scenarios than
					the select element allows. In the concept illustration below, selecting an invoice due
					date requires either a relative or an absolute value. This can be combined in one seamless
					flow using Pickers:

				<p>
					Pickers have been designed to work similarly across different devices and screen sizes, as
					a picker panel basically is a collection of form elements styled to meet phone styling
					requirements.
				</p>

				<p>
					For huge lists with hundreds or thousands of options, a search element can be enabled. In
					the following example the list of options contains a few hundred unit types. Only the
					previously used ones are shown. Access to the full list is provided by free text search:

				<h3>Copy Guidelines</h3>
				<p>
					Writing copy for pickers for the most part consists of writing copy for a bunch of
					individual elements that can be found elsewhere in the product. There are essentially
					three distinct groups of copy when it comes to pickers:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Title:</strong> The title should be as descriptive as possible regarding what
						the goal of the user is. Furthermore, the title should match the copy of the element
						that triggered the opening of the picker.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Body:</strong> The body can include two different elements:
						clarification/explanation copy, and value selectors. The selectors should follow the
						same guidelines as throughout the rest of the product. The clarification/explanation
						copy should be as clear as possible. No personality, no humor, this is strictly a help
						text in a complex flow, and its only goal is to clarify the actions expected of the
						user.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Buttons:</strong> Some pickers will include buttons. When they do, these follow
						the rules of buttons in the rest of the product. Read more about
						<a href="http://tradeshift.github.io/#design/patterns/buttons.html" data-ts="Button"
							>buttons</a
						>
						(including copy) here, or read the in-depth section on

					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Ways of presenting options</h3>

				<p>
					Picker’s are used whenever you need a field value populated from existing data. I.e. if
					the user clicks an input element and a value is returned to a field on the existing page,
					a picker should most often be used. Here are the standard option.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Single value selection</li>
					<li>Multiple value selection</li>
					<li>
						Advanced value selection: Drill-down with nested values in a hierarchy of pickers (tree
						structure)
					</li>
				</ul>

				</figure>

				<p><strong>Option manipulation</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Add option</li>
					<li>Modify option</li>
					<li>Remove option (part of edit)</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>
					<img alt="Option manipulation" src="assets/img/options-advanced-2.gif" />
				</figure>

				<p><strong>Navigation options</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Object navigation hub (click invoice in documents list and get options in picker)
					</li>
					<li>
						Advanced/custom use: Invoice line transformation across devices
					</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>
					<img
						alt="Advanced navigation with pickers"

					/>
				</figure>

				<h3>Simple options</h3>

				<p>
					Checkboxes (multi select or single value boolean) or radio buttons (single select)
					<em>can</em> be used when the following is true:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Less than 5 options in list</li>
					<li>Options cannot be manipulated</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>
					<img alt="Simple options" src="assets/img/options-simple.gif" />
				</figure>

				<p>
					The standard select element/dropdown is never used. In cases that is needed, always use a
					picker as this provides a more consistent user experience for value selection.
