# [Tradeshift UI](http://ui.tradeshift.com)

Tradeshift UI is a UI library to help you create apps that implement the [Tradeshift Design Principles](http://ui.tradeshift.com/#design/).
Check out our [documentation site](http://ui.tradeshift.com) to learn more about how it works and try out live code examples.

If you want to know about what the latest version is and what's new, check out our [releases page](http://github.com/Tradeshift/tradeshift-ui/releases).

If you'd like to submit a feature request or report a bug, go to our [issues pages](http://github.com/Tradeshift/tradeshift-ui/issues).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), either LTS or current.
1. Install the Grunt Command Line Utility globally.
	- `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. Install the dependencies of this project.
	- `npm install`

### Optional steps to set up the documentation site locally

1. Install the dependencies inside the `docs/` folder.
	- `cd docs; npm install`

## Usage (Local Development)

1. Start the `grunt` script in the root of the repository.
	- `grunt`
1. Use [`http://localhost:10111/dist/ts.js`](`http://localhost:10111/dist/ts.js`) in your app running locally to initialize Tradeshift UI.
1. Whenever you modify the source files, the script will rebuild the distribution files in `dist/` so you're always using the latest version.

### Optional steps to run the documentation site locally

1. Start the `grunt` script in the `docs/` folder.
	- `cd docs; grunt`
1. Navigate to [`http://localhost:10114/`](http://localhost:10114/) to view the documentation site locally.
1. Whenever you modify the source files, the script will rebuild the distribution files in `dist/` so you're always using the latest version.

## Git Hooks

Watch out, whenever you create a commit, the pre-commit hook will generate the documentation files, so the committed version works with GitHub pages.

## Documentation

If you want to browse our [documentation site](http://ui.tradeshift.com) you can do so easily.

## Release & Deployment

Make sure you have the following environment variables set:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[Your AWS Access Key ID]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[Your AWS Secret Access Key]
```

If you have the correct AWS access keys to release a new version of tradeshift-ui, you can do so using the `grunt release` command.
It will bump the version inside `package.json`, commit, tag release, upload to CloudFront and push to GitHub. Make sure to not do this on the `master` branch because it is protected from being pushed to directly.

## Running tests

Make sure you have a BrowserStack Automate account and have the following environment variables set:
```
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=[Your BrowserStack username]
export BROWSERSTACK_KEY=[Your BrowserStack key]
```

Then feel free to start running the tests as such:

`npm test`

This command will run all the Jasmine tests for all UI Components through BrowserStack.

We're currently testing on the following browsers:
* Google Chrome (latest, previous)
* Mozilla Firefox (latest, previous)
* Apple Safari (latest, previous)
* IE9, IE10, IE11
