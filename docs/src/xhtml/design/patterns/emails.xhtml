		<h1>Emails</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Points to keep in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Have exactly one message in your email</li>
				<li>Be concise and to the point of why did the user receive this email, what (re)action is expected from the user and which other party triggered the email to be sent</li>
				<li>Present the most expected action as a <a href="http://tradeshift.github.io/#design/copy/buttons.html" data-ts="Button"="">primary action button</a> just below the introductory text</li><li>Donâ€™t advertise. All promotion is managed by Tradeshift and sent out through opt-in newsletters. Application emails are for actions/app-events only. Irrelevant content dilute the signal-strength from other Tradeshift emails</li>
				<li>Make your emails work on mobile devices</li>
			</ul>
