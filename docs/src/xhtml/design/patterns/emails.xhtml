			<h1>Emails</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Points to keep in mind:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Have exactly one message in your email</li>
					<li>
						Be concise and to the point of why did the user receive this email, what (re)action is
						expected from the user and which other party triggered the email to be sent
					</li>
					<li>
						Present the most expected action as a
						<a href="http://tradeshift.github.io/#design/copy/buttons.html" data-ts="Button"
							>primary action button</a
						>
						just below the introductory text
					</li>
					<li>
						Don’t advertise. All promotion is managed by Tradeshift and sent out through opt-in
						newsletters. Application emails are for actions/app-events only. Irrelevant content
						dilute the signal-strength from other Tradeshift emails
					</li>
					<li>Make your emails work on mobile devices</li>
				</ul>
