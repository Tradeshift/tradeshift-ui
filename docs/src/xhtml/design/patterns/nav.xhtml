			<h1>Navigation Items</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					Menu items can be inserted in the Global Menu to provide direct access to your app.
				</p>

					/>
				</figure>

				<p>
					An application icon must be provided as well as a name for your application. A highlight
					color can be specified for your menu item, allowing integration of your visual identity in
					combination with your custom icon.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img
						alt="Shortcuts on a tablet"
						src="assets/img/navigation-global-tablet-shortcuts.png"
					/>
				</figure>

				<p>
					<strong>Shortcuts</strong> are only available in tablet size and are stacked vertically
					along the left side of the screen under the Tradeshift logo mark. The shortcuts are
					basically global menu items that have been defined to also appear in the shortcut list.
					This means that the shortcuts are a subset of the global menu items. Only specify your
					global menu item as a shortcut if frequent and repeated access to your functionality on
					mobile devices is necessary.
				</p>

				<h3>TopBar</h3>

				<p>The Topbar can be customized in a few different ways.</p>

				<figure>
					<img alt="Contextual actions" src="assets/img/navigation-contextual-actions.png" />
					<figcaption>Buttons for the TopBar</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					When using the TopBar to present buttons, the actions assoicated to the buttons are
					expected to manipulate the entirety of page contents; they are "top level" actions. The
					buttons are also
					<em>contextual</em> and can change with application state.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img alt="Invoice creation example" src="assets/img/button-styles-01.png" />
				</figure>

				<p>
					The invoice creation example has document delete, save and send as contextual actions.
					These actions modify the entirety of what's on the page. More fine-grained controls, such
					as adding lines, belong to the contents of the document, and should never appear in the
					contextual bar as actions. An alternative example (connector app and connections page) is
					when the page contains a collection of objects. In this case, the contextual action of
					adding another object to the collection is allowed as contextual action, as it alters the
					collection, being the highest level on that kind of page.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img alt="Tabbed navigation" src="assets/img/navigation-contextual-tabbed1.png" />
					<figcaption>Tabbed navigation</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					The TopBar can also contain tabs with the purpose of splitting related contents into
					subsections that can be processed individually in any given order. An example is this
					documentation.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img
						alt="Progress tabbed navigation in action"
						src="assets/img/navigation-contextual-tabbed-progress.png"
					/>
					<figcaption>Progress-tabbed navigation</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					When a tabbed navigation is preferred but there's a requirement for users to process all
					tabs in order, the progress-tabbed TopBar is used. Note that the progress-tabbed
					navigation leaves ample space for a flow headline, by keeping the progress tabs below the
					TopBar space. Progress-tabbed navigation works well for setup flows where all steps are
					required, such as a custom registration flow.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img alt="Searching in the TopBar" src="assets/img/navigation-contextual-search1.png" />
					<figcaption>Filtering and searching</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					For managing complex lists the TopBar can be completely exchanged with search and filter
					functionality. This is especially usable for long lists, such as the documents list pages.
				</p>

				<h3>Hidden</h3>

				<p>When the contextual bar doesn't do anything it can be completely removed. Note that in phone size UI there's always a bar containing the current page's title.</p>

				<h3>Combinations</h3>

				<p>It's not recommended to combine the above mentioned contextual bar types. For instance having both tabs and contextual actions simultaneously may work in some situations on desktop. But language variants (longer labels/titles) and fluidity across devices carry the risk of rendering your combined interface unusable for larger segments of users.</p>

				<h3>Pickers as navigation hubs</h3>

				<p><a href="http://tradeshift.github.io/#design/patterns/pickers.html" data-ts="Button">Pickers</a> also provide the opportunity to function as navigation items.</p>
